Through whispered trees and rustling leaves,
The breeze weaves songs that no one grieves.
In nature’s hush, our hearts can hear
The truths we’ve lost, now drawing near.

A lonely owl begins to call,
While midnight wraps the world in shawl.
Yet even in the dark so wide,
A flame of wonder burns inside
