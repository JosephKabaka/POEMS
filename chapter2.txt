Through whispered trees and rustling leaves,
The breeze weaves songs that no one grieves.
In nature’s hush, our hearts can hear
The truths we’ve lost, now drawing near.

A lonely owl begins to call,
While midnight wraps the world in shawl.
Yet even in the dark so wide,
A flame of wonder burns inside

The mountains stand with silent pride,
Their secrets buried deep inside.
They teach us strength, not just in might,
But in the calm that follows fight.

Thanks for reading this poem!
