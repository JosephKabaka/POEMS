Beneath the sky so wide and blue,
The morning wakes in drops of dew,
The sun climbs slow with golden grace,
And lights the dreams we dare to chase

The river sings its silver tune,
Reflecting shadows of the moon.
Its waters glide through stone and sand,
Like time itself through every land

The petals fall from trees above,
A quiet gift, a sign of love.
They land like thoughts we never speak,
Soft moments that the strong still seek.
