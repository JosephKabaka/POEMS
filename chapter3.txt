By evening’s glow and fading light,
We gather stars to guard the night.
In silence deep, we find our way—
A quiet hope that will not stray

We walk through life on paths unknown,
Yet never truly walk alone.
For every heartbeat, laugh, or sigh—
Connects us like the stars on high.

And when the dawn returns once more,
With light that spills on every shore,
We rise again, with clearer eyes—
Still chasing truth beneath the skies.
